## Carlos Nakid First Portfolio

### Project 1: [Simple Sales Analysis](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Simple-Sales-Analysis)
[Code](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Simple-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Simple%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)
* This project itÂ´s focus on my data approach bassed on a exploratory data analysis.

Some topics covered:
  * Combine data
  * Basic Feature Engineering
  * Plot results
  
Big Picture of the data:
* The data consists on 12 sales files.
* Everyone simulates the sales from an electronic store based on the United States
* The results could help (if real) business decisions.

### Preject 2: [Basic ML algorithm](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Titanic)
[Code](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Titanic/blob/main/Titanic%20Random%20Forest.ipynb)
* This project is based on the classic [Titanic Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) dataset
* The main goal is to show the process before get the hands-on the ML model
  * Understanding the data and prepare it
  * Plot some variables and their correlations
  * Working with missing values, outliers
  * Feature Engenieering
* Results for the basic ML algorithm

The main goal is to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived the accident or not.

### Project 3: [International Report Passengers](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Flights)
[Code](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Flights/blob/main/Flights.ipynb)
* This project its about how the US airline industry has been developed within the last 20 years based on the scheduled passenger flights
* Some techniques used:
   * Combining dataframes
   * Plotting
   * Extract info based on a single column
   * Data comparison 
* The info could give the reader some ideas/insights on how the industry has been developed the last 20 years and also make some conclusions about the flights market.
