### Project 1: [Simple Sales Analysis](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Simple-Sales-Analysis)

* This project itÂ´s focus on how I do the data aproach based on a simple exploratory analysis.
  * Combine data
  * Basic Feature Engineering
  * Plot results
  
* The data consists on 12 files each on them simulating the sales for an electronic store based on the United States
* The info here would help (if real) to make business decisions based on the results

* This project is based on the classic [Titanic Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) dataset
* I want to show the process I follow before I start working
  * Understanding the data
  * Plot some variables
  * Working with missing values, outliers
  * Feature Engenieering
* Results for the basic ML algorithm
