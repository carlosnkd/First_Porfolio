### Project 1: [Simple Sales Analysis](https://github.com/carlosnkd/Simple-Sales-Analysis)
* This project itÂ´s focus on how I do the data aproach based on a simple exploratory analysis.
  * Combine data
  * Basic Feature Engineering
  * Plot results
  
* The data consists on 12 files each on them simulating the sales for an electronic store based on the United States
* The info here would help (if real) to make business decisions based on the results

* I want to show the process I follow before I start working
  * Understanding the data
  * Plot some variables
  * Working with missing values, outliers

### Project 3: International Report Passengers
* This project its about how the US airline industry has develop within the last 20 years based on the scheduled passenger flights
* Some techniques used:
   * Combining dataframes
   * Plotting
   * Extract info based on a single column
   * Data comparison 
* The info could give the reader some ideas/insights on how the industry has develop the last 20 years and also make some conclusions about the flights market.
